This is a mental health dataset that I have sourced from Kaggle. I am using this dataset to be able to extract information 
regarding the clients concerns about how certain participants feel about there mental health

This would be able to provide employers with certain concerns where they would be able to accomadate employees with a
mental illness and how they can provide the support they will need.

First I will group each response by age group for those who have taken the survery in 2016 (Children, Youth, Adult, Seniors)

SELECT *,
    CASE WHEN AnswerText BETWEEN 1 AND 14 THEN 'Children'
         WHEN AnswerText BETWEEN 15 AND 24 THEN 'Youth'
         WHEN AnswerText BETWEEN 25 AND 64 THEN 'Adult'
         ELSE 'Seniors' END AS agegroup
FROM Answer A
JOIN Question Q
ON A.QuestionID = Q.questionid
WHERE Q.questionid = 1 AND SurveyID = 2016

Then I want to identify how many participents were there per age group to see which age groups are more active.

WITH agegroup AS (
SELECT *,
    CASE WHEN AnswerText BETWEEN 1 AND 14 THEN 'Children'
         WHEN AnswerText BETWEEN 15 AND 24 THEN 'Youth'
         WHEN AnswerText BETWEEN 25 AND 64 THEN 'Adult'
         ELSE 'Seniors' END AS agegroup
FROM Answer A
JOIN Question Q
ON A.QuestionID = Q.questionid
WHERE Q.questionid = 1 AND SurveyID = 2016
)
SELECT agegroup, COUNT(agegroup) AS ClientPerAgeGroup
FROM agegroup
GROUP BY agegroup 
ORDER BY 2;

The next question asks for there gender. I will get the age group per participant

WITH gender AS (
SELECT questiontext, AnswerText,UserId
FROM Answer a
JOIN Question q
ON a.QuestionID = q.questionid
WHERE q.questionid = 2 AND SurveyID = 2016
)
SELECT g.questiontext, g.AnswerText,
      CASE WHEN a.AnswerText BETWEEN 1 AND 14 THEN 'Children'
         WHEN a.AnswerText BETWEEN 15 AND 24 THEN 'Youth'
         WHEN a.AnswerText BETWEEN 25 AND 64 THEN 'Adult'
         ELSE 'Seniors' END AS agegroup
FROM gender g
JOIN Answer a
ON g.UserId = a.UserId
JOIN Question q
ON a.QuestionID = q.questionid
WHERE q.questionid = 1;

Now I want to visualize the locations of where the participants are located

WITH location AS (
SELECT AnswerText AS city, UserID
FROM Answer a
JOIN Question q
ON a.QuestionID = q.questionid
WHERE a.SurveyID = 2016 AND q.questionid = 4
ORDER BY a.UserID
)
SELECT a.AnswerText, city
FROM location l
JOIN Answer a
ON l.UserID = a.UserID
JOIN Question q
ON a.QuestionID = q.questionid
WHERE q.questionid = 3
ORDER BY a.UserId;

I want to know what mental conditions users are currently diagnosed with

SELECT a.UserID, a.AnswerText,  
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY a.UserID)
FROM Answer a
JOIN Question q
ON a.QuestionID = q.questionid
WHERE a.SurveyID = 2016 AND q.questionid = 115

In order to create a good representation of the data, I am trying to organize the data so that the questions are 
represented in columns insttead of rows

WITH age as (
SELECT a.UserID, a.AnswerText
FROM Answer a
JOIN Question q
ON a.QuestionID = q.questionid
WHERE SurveyID = 2016 AND q.questionid = 1
),
gender AS (
SELECT a.UserID, a.AnswerText
FROM Answer a
JOIN Question q
ON a.QuestionID = q.questionid
WHERE SurveyID = 2016 AND q.questionid = 2
),
country AS (
SELECT a.UserID, a.AnswerText
FROM Answer a
JOIN Question q
ON a.QuestionID = q.questionid
WHERE SurveyID = 2016 AND q.questionid = 3
),
benefits AS (
SELECT a.UserID, a.AnswerText
FROM Answer a
JOIN Question q
ON a.QuestionID = q.questionid
WHERE SurveyID = 2016 AND q.questionid = 10
),
anonymity AS (
SELECT a.UserID, a.AnswerText
FROM Answer a
JOIN Question q
ON a.QuestionID = q.questionid
WHERE SurveyID = 2016 AND q.questionid = 11
)
SELECT a.UserID, a.AnswerText AS age, g.AnswerText AS gender, 
    c.Answertext AS country, b.AnswerText AS benefits,
    anon.AnswerText AS anonymity
FROM age a
JOIN gender g
ON a.UserID = g.UserID
JOIN country c
ON a.UserID = c.UserID
JOIN benefits b
ON a.UserID = b.UserID
JOIN anonymity anon
ON a.UserID = anon.UserID;
