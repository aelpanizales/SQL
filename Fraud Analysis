In this project, I have pulled a dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection) to work on. My 
purpose of this project is to see if I can identify a reoccuring pattern to be able to pinpoint the cause for fraud activity.

Which merchants are seeing the most cases of fraud activity? 

SELECT merchant, COUNT(is_fraud)
FROM fraudtrain
WHERE is_fraud = 1
GROUP BY merchant
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

What is the most recent fraud transaction?

SELECT *
FROM fraudtrain
WHERE is_fraud = 1
ORDER BY trans_date_trans_time DESC;

Pull up the most last 10 transanctions of the customer whose recent transaction was flagged as fraud? 

SELECT *
FROM fraudtrain
WHERE first = 'William' AND last = 'Perry'
ORDER BY trans_date_trans_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

Upon pulling up William Perrys information, I noticed that, there were two similar purchases made within 2 hours of eachother. But due to the lack of
merchant location, it was difficult for me locate the exact location of each transaction. It is possible that the transsaction was deemed fraud for a potential 
inconsistent geo location pings.

Using this same simple format above I will take a look another cusomters whos transaction was flagged as fraud

WITH CTE_ashley AS
(
SELECT * 
FROM fraudtrain
WHERE first = 'Ashley' AND last = 'Cabrera'
)
SELECT merchant, AVG(amt) AS avgspend
FROM CTE_ashley
WHERE merchant = 'fraud_Kassulke PLC' AND is_fraud = 0

Taking a look at Ashley typical spend at each store respectively at Kassulke her average spend is $130.13 and at Schumm her average spend is $18.14
Her recent 2 transactions are well abover her average spend.

SELECT merchant, AVG(amt) AS avgspend
FROM fraudtrain
WHERE merchant = 'fraud_Schumm PLC' OR merchant = 'fraud_Kassulke PLC'
GROUP BY merchant

Upon looking at the average spend overall at both stores. Typically customer spend $82.47 at Kassulke and $70.51 at Schumm
This data can also support that the recent spend at the store is not normal.

Further investigation would be needed and confirmed with the customer to confirm authortizaton of payment.

Is there a relationship between fraud counts and job? 

SELECT job, COUNT(is_fraud)
FROM fraudtrain
WHERE is_fraud = 1
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

Without knowing the actaul pay range for each job, I decided to look at each 'Material Engineer' where fraud has been 
noted for their typical spend to get a good barometer of job salary expectations.

Here we have 6 clients who has been affected by fraud.

SELECT first, last, COUNT(is_fraud)
FROM fraudtrain
WHERE job = 'Materials engineer' AND is_fraud = 1
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3;

This statement shows the average spend and range of spend for the 6 clients affected by fraud.

SELECT first, last, AVG(amt), MAX(amt), MIN(amt)
FROM fraudtrain
WHERE job = 'Materials engineer' AND is_fraud != 1
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3;

What category sees the most fraud transanction?

SELECT category, COUNT(is_fraud) 
FROM fraudtrain
WHERE is_fraud = 1
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

Upon pulling the data of I took the most recent fraud transanction from that category.
The customer that had experience the most recent fraud transanction from the Grocery category,
Has seen a large sum of money spent in 1 day. Looking at previous spending patterns. These transanctions
do seem to be out of the ordinary. Further investigation would be needed as the customers CC seems to have been
comprised.
