*/ In this project, I pulled the data off of Kaggle. It is a dataset that includes data of NBA players, teams, saleries, and more. 
In this project, I decided to take the point of view of a NBA scout. I wanted to analyze how to find the what college school produces the most successful players 
in the NBA. */


#1. What college currently has the most players in the NBA?
SELECT SCHOOL, COUNT(SCHOOL)
FROM Player p
JOIN Player_Attributes pa
ON p.full_name = pa.DISPLAY_FIRST_LAST
WHERE is_active = 1
GROUP BY SCHOOL ORDER BY COUNT(SCHOOL) DESC; 

#2. What college produces the most All-Stars?
SELECT SCHOOL, COUNT(ALL_STAR_APPEARANCES)
FROM Player p
JOIN Player_Attributes pa
ON p.full_name = pa.DISPLAY_FIRST_LAST
WHERE is_active = 1
GROUP BY SCHOOL ORDER BY COUNT(ALL_STAR_APPEARANCES) DESC;

#3. What schools have players active and retired that average 
at least 15 pts, 3 ast and 2 reb with 5 years experience?
SELECT SCHOOL, COUNT(SCHOOL)
FROM Player p
JOIN Player_Attributes pa
ON p.full_name = pa.DISPLAY_FIRST_LAST
WHERE PTS >= 15 AND AST >= 3 AND REB >= 2 AND SEASON_EXP >=5
GROUP BY SCHOOL ORDER BY COUNT(SCHOOL) DESC;

#4. What school had the most players get drafted in the first round?
SELECT SCHOOL, COUNT(SCHOOL)
FROM Player p
JOIN Player_Attributes pa
ON p.full_name = pa.DISPLAY_FIRST_LAST
WHERE DRAFT_ROUND = 1
GROUP BY SCHOOL ORDER BY COUNT(SCHOOL) DESC;

#5. How many players were drafted each year from Kentucky from 2014 to 2019?
SELECT SCHOOL, DRAFT_YEAR, COUNT(DRAFT_YEAR)
FROM Player p
JOIN Player_Attributes pa
ON p.full_name = pa.DISPLAY_FIRST_LAST
WHERE is_active = 1 AND SCHOOL = 'Kentucky' AND DRAFT_YEAR != 'Undrafted'
GROUP BY DRAFT_YEAR ORDER BY (DRAFT_YEAR) DESC
LIMIT 6;

#6. Which school has seen increase in players drafted in the last 10 years?
