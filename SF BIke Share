*/ In this project, the dataset was pulled from Kaggle. I first queried some results to get an idea of what type of data would be useful then
I am looking to see which bike stations are most popular. */

#1. How many different stations are there in SF Bay?
SELECT DISTINCT station_id
FROM status;

#2. Which how many docks are avaible at each station?
SELECT id, dock_count
FROM station
ORDER BY dock_count DESC;

#3. What and where are the most recently installed docks?
SELECT id, city, installation_date
FROM station
ORDER BY installation_date ASC;

#4. Which city has the most dock_stations?
SELECT city, COUNT(id)
FROM station
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC;

#5. What stations currently have 0 bikes available?
SELECT s.station_id, ss.city, ss.name, s.bikes_available, ss.dock_count
FROM status s
JOIN station ss
ON s.station_id = ss.id
WHERE bikes_available = 0 AND time LIKE '%2015-08-31%'
GROUP BY station_id
ORDER BY time DESC;


#6. What stations are currently full?
SELECT  s.station_id, ss.city, ss.name, s.bikes_available, ss.dock_count
FROM status s
JOIN station ss
ON s.station_id = ss.id
