**In this project I pulled info from a database named chinook that contained data from a digital media store. The 11 tables in the database includes data on albums, 
customers, employees, and invoices. See the questions I asked and the SQL I used to answer the questions raised below.**

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country != "USA";

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT * 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country. 
SELECT FirstName, LastName, InvoiceId, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices AS i
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers AS c
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, InvoiceId
FROM chinook.customers AS c
JOIN chinook.employees AS e
ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices AS i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.BillingCountry, i.Total, e.FirstName AS AgentFirstName, e.LastName AS AgentLastName
FROM chinook.customers AS c
JOIN chinook.employees AS e
ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices AS i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceDate)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line item.
SELECT t.Name, ii.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks AS t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items as ii
ON t.TrackId = ii.TrackId

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND composer name with each invoice line item.
SELECT t.Name, t.Composer, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i 
JOIN chinook.Tracks t ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;
